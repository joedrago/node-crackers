This big pile of sloppy, rough-drafty code offers a way to track what you've read. It requires user auth on your server, php+mysqli, and some other stuff. This isn't ready for primetime yet, but I wanted to have it in git.

TODO: Explain this directory better, make code less sloppy, rewrite PHP code in a better language (read: anything).
