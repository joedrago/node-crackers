## Hints and Tips

* Settings are per-device.
* Settings are automatically saved when changed.
* On desktop, try out Autoread (D/F). It cycles between:
  * Zoom to top left
  * Zoom to bottom right
  * Go to next page
* Disabling animations in the settings can help slow devices.
* On small touch devices, try enabling the zoomgrid!
  * It makes the bottom center of the screen have a 3x3 grid which allows for quick zooming in and out.
  * Press and hold in the bottom center to make the grid appear and use it.
  * Dragging to any edge of the zoom grid will snap your view to that position.
  * Dragging in the center square will free pan.
  * Tapping quickly anywhere in the zoomgrid will zoom out (required for going to the next page).
